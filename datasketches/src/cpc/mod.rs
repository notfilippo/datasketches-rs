//! The cpc package contains implementations of Kevin J. Langâ€™s CPC sketch. The
//! stored CPC sketch can consume about 40% less space than an HLL sketch of
//! comparable accuracy. Nonetheless, the HLL and CPC sketches have been
//! intentially designed to offer different tradeoffs so that, in fact, they
//! complement each other in many ways.
//!
//! Similar to the HLL sketch, the primary use-case for the CPC sketch is for
//! counting distinct values as a stream, and then merging multiple sketches
//! together for a total distinct count.
//!
//! Neither HLL nor CPC sketches provide means for set intersections or set
//! differences. If you anticipate your application might require this
//! capability you are better off using the Theta family of sketches.

//! The hll module contains a set of very compact implementations of Phillipe
//! Flajoletâ€™s HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch but with significantly improved error
//! behavior and excellent speed performance.
//! If the use case for sketching is primarily counting uniques and merging, the
//! HLL sketch is the 2nd highest performing in terms of accuracy for storage
//! space consumed (the new CPC sketch developed by Kevin J. Lang now beats HLL).
//! For large counts, HLL sketches can be 2 to 16 times smaller for the same
//! accuracy than the Theta Sketches mentioned above, and the CPC sketch is
//! another 30 to 40% smaller still.

/// Specifies the target type of HLL sketch to be created. It is a target in that the actual
/// allocation of the HLL array is deferred until sufficient number of items have been received by
/// the warm-up phases.
///
/// These three target types are isomorphic representations of the same underlying HLL algorithm.
/// Thus, given the same value of `lg_config_k` and the same input, all three HLL target types
/// will produce identical estimates and have identical error distributions.
///
/// The memory (and also the serialization) of the sketch during this early warmup phase starts
/// out very small (8 bytes, when empty) and then grows in increments of 4 bytes as required
/// until the full HLL array is allocated.  This transition point occurs at about 10% of K for
/// sketches where `lg_config_k` is > 8.
